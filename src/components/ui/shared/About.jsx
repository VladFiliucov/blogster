    <p>So you want to be a blogger, do you?  Blogging over the long term takes: Passion, Purpose, Productivity, People Skills, Planning and Persistence. Many bloggers don’t have what it takes because a significant number of blogs registered today will be abandoned or deleted in less than a year from the date of their creation.</p>

      <p>That’s why answering the question: Do I have what it takes to blog over the long term? is critical to your success.</p>

  <p>If you think you have what it takes and are determined to stay the course then know that bogging begins with defining a purpose for your blog that clearly expresses your aim to blog with passion about something that matters. On one hand, in-depth knowledge of the topic you are writing on will make your blogging easier. On the other, no matter how much knowledge you have muddling along without expressing your blog’s purpose can lead reader confusion and blogger burn-out. From the outset you need to be able to describe  your blog’s purpose by expressing what you intend to blog about in as few words as possible.</p>
